    <h1>To you, my love</h1>

    <div class="text">
        Your eyes, two stars that illuminate my being, 
    in the vast sky of my dreams, your light makes me reborn. 
    Your smile, a bright sun that lights up my peace, 
    it is on your lips where my soul finds its rhythm. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Your laughter, a melody that dances with the wind, 
    and your voice, a soft song that calms my torments. 
    Your presence is the breeze that caresses my skin, 
    in each step of yours, my world becomes one. 
    <br>
    <br>
    There is nothing more beautiful than seeing how you walk, 
    like the sea that slides, soft, without haste. 
    Your attitude, a fire that lights up the universe, 
    firm, brave, in each verse. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Your being, a garden full of fragrances and colors, 
    where my feelings flourish, where my loves are born. 
    You are my muse, my inspiration, my melody, 
    my sun every day, my moon on every cold night. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I admire you, I love you, without measure or end, 
    and by your side, my love, I want to live and continue, 
    walking together on this endless path, 
    because what I feel for you is an immortal love.
